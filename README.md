# What it does
Jira Hook Ninja allows you to create infinite webhooks listeners and attach to them what we call flows. A flow is a small application created using visual scripting, that works by dragging and dropping blocks that describe the application in terms that make sense for humans, so even non-technical people can develop a complex logic. When you receive a webhook, the associated flow is executed, and your logic determines if it needs to create a ticket on Jira and how it should be configured.
